# Mini-Project 3: MiniProject 3: Modified MNIST
- **Goal**: Detect numerically largest digit in the image: this is an **object detection task**. 

## Our paper: 
- https://www.overleaf.com/5792449574grsgjxdvsbfw

## Announcements: 
- Our group on MyCourses is **Group 9**, please join ASAP 
- Once the above is done, please join the Kaggle competition on **Group 9**
- If we collect sources along the way, please make sure you write document them down in the **literature** folder.
- As possible, we will try to work using **branching**. We wil upload some initial scripts that are more or less complete to the **master** branch, but whenever other changes are to be made, please initialize a **pull request**. We will then discuss when meging the code and/or branches. 
- When a task is done, please put **done** next to it, but please don't delete the whole task until 2 days later so we can all know how progress is going. 
- We can all mess around with code on our own computers, however since we will be trianing Neural Nets, we will be using **Google Colab**. 
- **Meeting tomorrow 4pm **
